## About Me

I am a third-year university student at UMFST George Emil Palade, where I passionately study programming and computer science. I have gained experience in several programming languages: I am proficient in C/C++, Java, C#, and Kotlin, and I also have basic knowledge in Python.

As a dedicated student, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies. I am open to new challenges and eagerly look forward to opportunities where I can apply my acquired skills in practical projects. My goal is to gain deeper expertise in the field of programming.
